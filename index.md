# Welcome to ENGR 523 ( CSCI B649)

Spring 2019

# Description

From servers to smartphones, our world has been revolutionized by the modern
computer.  The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to again revolutionize how we
interact with computing, this time embedding compute deep within our urban
environments, in homes, in ourselves, and many other places.  These devices
must be reliable, networked, and self-powered, enabling them to go unmaintained
for decades, allowing for computation that seamlessly fades into the background
of everyday life.  

This class will be a mix of topical discussions and hands-on programming.
Rather than giving a wide-ranging overview of IoT, we will instead focus on a
single project within the IoT domain.  Thus, a large portion of this class will
focus on *designing* and *implimenting* software solutions for a specific IoT
problem, acoustic (audio) event detection.  Due to time constraints, we will be
using standardized hardware.
