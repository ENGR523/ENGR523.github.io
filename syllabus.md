# ENGR 523 ( CSCI B649) Syllabus

Spring 2019

## Description

From servers to smartphones, our world has been revolutionized by the modern
computer.  The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to again revolutionize how we
interact with computing, this time embedding compute deep within our urban
environments, in homes, in ourselves, and many other places.  These devices
must be reliable, networked, and self-powered, enabling them to go unmaintained
for decades, allowing for computation that seamlessly fades into the background
of everyday life.  

This class will be a mix of topical discussions and hands-on programming.
It will focus on topics IoT-scale systems, including:
* Application domains
* Digital signal processing
* Wireless communication 
* Energy constraints and harvesting
* Systems designs / architectures

A large portion of this class will focus on *designing* and *implimenting*
software solutions for a specific IoT problem, accoustic event detection.  Due
to time constraints, we will be using standardized hardware.

## Schedule
09:30A-10:45A   Monday/Wednesday  
IF 4012 (Luddy Hall)  

## Prerequisites

This class *assumes you are familiar with embedded systems* (ENGR 314, CSCI P442,
or equivalent).  We will assume familiarity with topics such as
low-level programming for embedded processors (C/assembly), basic hardware
structures (ADCs, DACs, timers, etc), and basic familiarity with testbench
equipment (multimeter/oscilloscope).  

Students without such background are advised to consult the instructor.  


## Deliverables


### Assignments 

We will have multiple assignments over the semester. These will start simple and
gradually become more complex.  You will be given the hardware.  

The (tentative) assignments include: 
 
* Internet-triggered blinking LEDs
* Polling-based audio data capture 
* DMA-based audio data capture + Internet-uploading
* Cloud-based audio event detection 

You will be allowed to work in *teams of two*.

### Project 

This class will also feature a end-of-the-semester project focused on designing
and implementing a low-power on-board audio-event detection system. You will be
allowed to work in teams of two or three for this project.  It will involve a
final written report and a presentation/demonstration to the class. 

### Reviews

The second half of the semester will involve reading papers.  Initially we will
start with a single paper per class, but will gradually progress to two papers
per class.  You will be responsible for reading the paper before class and
writing a short review of the assigned paper(s) and submiting it via Canvas. 

The review should answer the following questions:

* What is the problem the paper addresses? 
* Why is it important?  
* What is the key observation or hypothesis the paper makes?  
* What key assumptions does the paper makes?
* What are the main strengths of this paper?
* What are the main weaknesses of this paper?
* Which figure or experiment was most compelling in support of their argument? Why? 


## In-class Participation

You are expected to participate in the in-class discussions.  As such,
attendance is mandatory.  Attendance will be taken periodically.  Unexcused absences will impact your final grade.

## Grading Policy

The tentative point distribution is included below.  It is not likely that this
will change, but circumstances might occur which would make changes necessary,
at the discretion of the instructor. *Once a grade has been posted to Canvas,
you will have one week to appeal the grade.*

 * Paper Reviews: 10% 
 * In-class Participation: 10%
 * Assignments: 45%
 * Project:  35%

## Due Dates and Extensions
 
**Assignments turned in after the exact time and date on the assignment will
receive a zero**. We do not generally offer extensions. For example, we do not
offer extensions due to crowded computing sites, internet access problems,
accidental erasure or loss of files, or outside conflicting commitments.

We will consider extension requests made in person and at least two weeks in
advance, for example, for religious holidays or planned medical procedures.
Additionally, we will consider requests for extensions due to documented,
unanticipated medical or personal emergencies. If you can't see the instructor
in advance due to the emergency, then contact them as soon as you possibly can.
In all cases, we require written proof of the emergency.

## Forum

We will be using Piazza to host a course forum. You are encouraged to read this regularly and post technical questions as it will be a significant source of help and hints on the projects. We do not answer technical questions via email. To save everyone time, we want all students to have the benefit of seeing each question and its answer, so please use the forum. We prohibit posting your own solutions, project code, test cases, or autograder output to the forum.

## Academic Integrity

Learning difficult or complicated material is often facilitated by discussions
between students and we encourage you to form study groups to try to solve
difficult problems together.

However, **exams and programming projects must be your own work**. Do not cheat
in any way: do your own work! Doing your own work means that you must turn in
your own, original work. It means you do not turn in a solution copied from
somebody else or found on the web. In programming projects, working together may
extend to figuring out overall strategies for solution but **you may not work
together or share the actual code** that you submit.

## Disability Services for Students

If you think you need an accommodation for a disability, please let your
instructor know during the first three weeks of the semester. Some aspects of
this course may be modified to facilitate your participation and progress. As
soon as you make us aware of your needs, we can work with the Office of
Disability Services for Students (DSS) help us determine appropriate academic
accommodations. Any information you provide is private and confidential and will
be treated as such.

## Corrections and Clarifications

We will post a Canvas announcement in the case of any critical corrections or
clarifications. It is your responsibility to ensure you are able to receive
Canvas announcements.
