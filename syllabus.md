# ENGR 523 ( CSCI B649) Syllabus

Spring 2019

## Description

From servers to smartphones, our world has been revolutionized by the modern
computer.  The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to again revolutionize how we
interact with computing, this time embedding compute deep within our urban
environments, in homes, in ourselves, and many other places.  These devices
must be reliable, networked, and self-powered, enabling them to go unmaintained
for decades, allowing for computation that seamlessly fades into the background
of everyday life.  

This class will be a mix of topical discussions and hands-on programming.
A large portion of this class will focus on *designing* and *implimenting*
software solutions for a specific IoT problem, acoustic (audio) event detection.  Due
to time constraints, we will be using standardized hardware. 

## Instructor

2030 Luddy Hall 

## Schedule
09:30A-10:45A   Monday/Wednesday  
IF 4012 (Luddy Hall)  

## Prerequisites

This class *assumes you are familiar with embedded systems* (ENGR 314, CSCI P442,
or equivalent).  We will assume familiarity with topics such as
low-level programming for embedded processors (C/assembly), basic hardware
structures (ADCs, DACs, timers, etc), and basic familiarity with testbench
equipment (multimeter/oscilloscope).  

Students without such background are advised to consult the instructor.  

## Textbook

No textbook is required, but the following can be helpful:

 * [Think DSP](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-dsp/)
 * [Particle Documentation](https://docs.particle.io/)

## Topics Covered

* IoT broadly
* Embedded-Systems
  * Networking
  * Analog-to-digital converters
  * Direct memory access 
* Audio Processing
  * Sampling
  * Filtering
  * FFT
  * MFCC
* Machine Learning 
  * Baysian networks
  * Fully-connected networks

## Projects

Over the course of the semester, we will assign multiple programming projects.
Full points will requires these projects be submitted to the autograder and/or be
demonstrated to the TA. These projects will involve writing both C code for
embedded systems and python code for a standard Linux machine.  

You will be allowed to work in **teams of two**.

## Due Dates and Extensions

**Assignments turned in after the exact time and date on the assignment will
receive a zero**. We do not generally offer extensions. For example, we do not
offer extensions due to crowded computing sites, long queue times or slow
response times on the autograder, internet access problems, accidental erasure
or loss of files, or outside conflicting commitments.

We will consider extension requests made in person and at least two weeks in
advance, for example, for religious holidays or planned medical procedures.
Additionally, we will consider requests for extensions due to documented,
unanticipated medical or personal emergencies. If you can't see the instructor
in advance due to the emergency, then contact them as soon as you possibly can.
In all cases, we require written proof of the emergency.

## Grading

Your final grade is based on scores from the standard projects, the final
project, and one midterm. The tentative point distribution is included in the
following table. It is not likely that this will change, but circumstances might
occur which would make changes necessary, at the discretion of the instructor.
*Once a grade has been posted to Canvas, you will have one week to appeal the
grade.*

| Standard Projects | Midterm       | Final Project |
| -------------     | -----------   | --------      |
| 50%               |    25%        |  25%          | 

## The Autograder

We will grade your programs in an autograder system that is similar to the Linux
environment. Your code must be submitted, compile, and run correctly on the
autograder before the deadline. We use a web-based autograder for project
submissions. For some projects, the autograder will also evaluate the
thoroughness of test cases you submit.

Note that for security reasons, the autograder website is only accessible from
within the IU network. Therefore, you must either be on campus or connected
through a VPN to access the website.

## Forum

We will be using Piazza to host a course forum. You are encouraged to read this
regularly and post technical questions as it will be a significant source of
help and hints on the projects. *We do not answer technical questions via
email*. To save everyone time, we want all students to have the benefit of
seeing each question and its answer, so please use the forum. We prohibit
posting your own solutions, project code, test cases, or autograder output to
the forum.

## Academic Integrity

Learning difficult or complicated material is often facilitated by discussions
between students and we encourage you to form study groups to try to solve
difficult problems together.

However, **exams and programming projects must be your own work**. Do not cheat
in any way: do your own work! Doing your own work means that you must turn in
your own, original work. It means you do not turn in a solution copied from
somebody else or found on the web. In programming projects, working together may
extend to figuring out overall strategies for solution but **you may not work
together or share the actual code** that you submit. 

For projects where teams are allowed, the group is allowed to share all code between
group members, but not outside of the group.  

## Disability Services for Students

If you think you need an accommodation for a disability, please let your
instructor know during the first three weeks of the semester. Some aspects of
this course may be modified to facilitate your participation and progress. As
soon as you make us aware of your needs, we can work with the Office of
Disability Services for Students (DSS) help us determine appropriate academic
accommodations. Any information you provide is private and confidential and will
be treated as such.

## Corrections and Clarifications

We will post a Canvas announcement in the case of any critical corrections or
clarifications. It is your responsibility to ensure you are able to receive
Canvas announcements.
