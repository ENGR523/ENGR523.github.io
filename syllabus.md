# ENGR 523 ( CSCI B649) Syllabus

Spring 2019

## Description

From servers to smartphones, our world has been revolutionized by the modern
computer.  The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to again revolutionize how we
interact with computing, this time embedding compute deep within our urban
environments, in homes, in ourselves, and many other places.  These devices
must be reliable, networked, and self-powered, enabling them to go unmaintained
for decades, allowing for computation that seamlessly fades into the background
of everyday life.  

This class will be a mix of topical discussions and hands-on programming.
It will focus on topics IoT-scale systems, including:
* Application domains
* Digital signal processing
* Wireless communication 
* Energy constraints and harvesting
* Systems designs / architectures

Due to time constraints, this class will focus on *designing* and *implimenting*
a solution to a *specific* IoT problem, energy-efficient audio-based event
detection.  To minimize complexity, we will be using standardized hardware.

## Schedule
09:30A-10:45A   Monday/Wednesday  
IF 4012 (Luddy Hall)  

## Prerequisites

This class assumes you are familiar with embedded systems (ENGR 314, CSCI P442,
or equivalent).  As such, we will assume familiarity with topics such as
low-level programming for embedded processors (C/assembly), basic hardware
structures (ADCs, DACs, timers, etc), and basic familiarity with testbench
equipment (multimeter/oscilloscope).  

Students without such background are advised to consult the instructor.  


## Deliverables


### Assignments 

We will have multiple assignments over the semester. These will start simple and
gradually become more complex.  You will be given the hardware.  

The (tentative) assignments include: 
 
* Internet-triggered blinking LEDs
* Polling-based audio data capture 
* DMA-based audio data capture + Internet-uploading
* Cloud-based audio event detection 

You will be allowed to work in *teams of two*.

### Project 

This class will also feature a end-of-the-semester project focused on designing
and implementing a low-power on-board audio-event detection system. You will be
allowed to work in teams of two or three for this project.  It will involve a
final written report and a presentation/demonstration to the class. 

### Reviews

The second half of the semester will involve reading papers.  Initially we will
start with a single paper per class, but will gradually progress to two papers
per class.  You will be responsible for reading the paper before class and
writing a short review of the assigned paper(s) and submiting it via Canvas. 

The review should answer the following questions:

* What is the problem the paper addresses? 
* Why is it important?  
* What is the key observation or hypothesis the paper makes?  
* What key assumptions does the paper makes?
* What are the main strengths of this paper?
* What are the main weaknesses of this paper?
* Which figure or experiment was most compelling in support of their argument? Why? 


## In-class Participation

You are expected to participate in the in-class discussions.  As such,
attendance is mandatory.  Attendance will be taken periodically.  Unexcused absences will impact your final grade.

## Grading Policy

Your grade for the course will be based on:

 * Paper Reviews: 10% 
 * In-class Participation: 10%
 * Assignments: 45%
 * Project:  35%

## Late Policy

**I do not accept any late work**, except in cases of documentable personal or
medical emergencies.  


## Forum

We will be using Piazza to host a course forum. You are encouraged to read this regularly and post technical questions as it will be a significant source of help and hints on the projects. We do not answer technical questions via email. To save everyone time, we want all students to have the benefit of seeing each question and its answer, so please use the forum. We prohibit posting your own solutions, project code, test cases, or autograder output to the forum.
